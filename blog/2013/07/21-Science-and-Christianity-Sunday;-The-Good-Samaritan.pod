This was supposed to be my blog entry from I<Last> Sunday, not this Sunday.
Furthermore, I was unable to complete this or any other blog entry all week!
But, hopefully finishing this will get me back into regular blogging again.

L<Last Sunday's Gospel|http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=270> was 
about the Good Samaritan. For the fun of it, let's take two passes at this
story.

The children's sermon on this topic goes like this: a man who is on the road 
gets robbed and beaten up. A few folks pass him by, but someone eventually helps 
him out, going well above the call of duty in this situation. The moral of the 
story is pretty simple: if you see somebody who needs help, offer to help them 
beyond their expectations. If your interpretation goes no further than this, you 
will still have a good interpretation. The genius of Jesus' parables is that 
even the simplest level of interpretation is good and instructive.

But Jesus' parables always have more depth. Let's look more closely. Here is the 
full text, taken from the link posted at the start of this post:

Just then a lawyer stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he said, "what must I do 
to inherit eternal life?" He said to him, "What is written in the law? What do 
you read there?" He answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your 
heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your 
mind; and your neighbor as yourself." And he said to him, "You have given the 
right answer; do this, and you will live." But wanting to justify himself, he 
asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"

Jesus replied, "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell into 
the hands of robbers, who stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him 
half dead. Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him, 
he passed by on the other side. So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place 
and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan while traveling came 
near him; and when he saw him, he was moved with pity. He went to him and 
bandaged his wounds, having poured oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his 
own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. The next day he took 
out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said, 'Take care of him; and 
when I come back, I will repay you whatever more you spend.' Which of these 
three, do you think, was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the 
robbers?" He said, "The one who showed him mercy." Jesus said to him, "Go and do 
likewise."

Even the setup of this parable is wonderful. Jesus was a traveling rabi and he 
must have been asked similar questions many times, and turned the question 
around on his listener many times. How often do you think he got back such a 
wonderful, succinct answer? The Lawyer's response summarizes the Law, with a 
strong dose of prophetic wisdom and interpretation. Clearly this was a man who 
gave careful thought to his faith. Jesus noticed this carefully considered man 
and followed up his excellent answer with a thought provoking parable.

It is easy for modern day listeners to miss just how thought provoking this 
story is. To understand why, you need to know a few things about stereotypes in 
Jewish culture from the classical period. These provide depth to an interesting 
but otherwise straight-forward story.

The man questioning Jesus is a "Lawyer". Not only did he demonstrate a careful 
interpretation of the Law, but in all likelyhood this was a man who strove to 
align his life as closely as possible with the Jewish Law. Without going into 
too much detail, the Jewish law had a number of strict ordinances for what 
individuals could or could not do, and what sorts of rituals they had to perform 
if they accidentally or intentially did something forbidden. It is not uncommon, 
but incorrect, to think that Jesus' establishment of Christianity broke the old 
Jewish law. Although there is a kernel of truth in it, Jesus nonetheless frames 
the whole story and his entire ministry in terms of the Jewish Law and Jewish 
cultural customs. Indeed, Jesus' main point is that the legalistic way of living 
that had been perfected by some in the classical Jewish culture was morally 
flawed.

Let's cover a little bit of history, by which I mean, a bit of Genesis and 
Exodus. If you've ever seen L<Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream 
Coat|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_and_the_Amazing_Technicolor_Dreamcoat>, 
you know that L<Joseph|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_%28Hebrew_Bible%29> 
was one of twelve sons of Jacob. Jacob's twelve sons moved to Egypt during a 
time of famine and eventually their descendents became enslaved. The Exodus 
tells the story of their departure from Egypt and their formation of a new state 
of Israel. (Israel was another name for Jacob, the father of the twelve sons.) 
Each of the twelve sons' descendents were formed into a tribe named for the son. 
Joseph had a tribe, for example. Judah was the eldest, and his descendents were 
"from the tribe of Juday". Benjamin was the youngest. One of the twelve brothers 
was Levi, and his descendents were called "Levites". In particular, Moses was a 
Levite and as a result all priests of Israel came from the line of the Levites.

Now fast forward a few hundred years. Internal factions have caused the tribe of 
Judah to split into its own state apart from Israel. Israel is the first to 
fall, and when they do, the conquering power (the Assyrians, I think) send in a 
whole bunch of foreigners into the land. The culture and religion of what was 
once Israel become entwined with other cultures and religions from these 
foreigners. This land comes to be called Samaria, after the capital, and its 
inhabitants are known as Samaritans. Jews hated Samritans because they claimed 
to worship the same God, but clearly their practices pulled from other 
traditions. These people were seen literally, culturally, and religiously as
half-breeds by the citizens of Judaeah. Fast forward another few hundred years
and we are in Jesus' time, and the notions haven't changed.

Having covered that history, you can appreciate the ordering that Jesus uses to 
introduce his characters. The priest is the holiest of the three. The Levite is 
a "cousin" of the priest; you might think of him as a man whose brother is a 
preacher. Even if he's not a preacher himself, he's probably had late-night 
conversations about ethical and moral behavior. Finally, the Samaritan is the 
morally ugly one. Jesus audience would have expected that even if this man had 
given careful thought to moral and ethical behavior, he would have started with 
a flawed religion and culture. Jesus introduces individuals of stereotypically
decreasing moral training and insight.

But why, then, do the priest and Levite, who should have had compassion, pass 
this poor robbed man? Rather than help the man, I<both> of them pass "one the 
other side". That's akin to a person walking down the street and B<crossing the 
street> just to avoid running into someone they consider unsavory. In case you 
can't picture it, imagine a nicely dressed white couple walking down a sidewalk 
late in the evening after a party, and crossing to the other side of the street 
when they see a hooded black man coming the other direction. The responses by 
the preist and the Levite to this poor robbed man are as "safe" and "cautious" 
as they are offensive.

The reason the priest and Levite avoided this half-dead man was because they 
were pious I<to> the Jewish Law. In a number of circumstances, this sort of 
piety translateed into morally and ethically sound behavior. In a number of 
other circumstances, it did not. As I said, the Law had all sorts of 
requirements, and obligations if you missed a requirement. The troubled history 
of the state of Israel led Jews in Jesus' day to strive above all else to avoid 
breaking the Law, and all sorts of things became taboo to Jews 2000 years ago. 
One such thing was contact with human blood. Both the uber-pious priest and the 
pious Levite see this robbed, beaten man and rather than see a man who needs 
help, they think "unclean". Rather than allow compassion to fill their hearts 
with pity, they harden their hearts and cross to the other side of the road to 
protect their ritual purity.

Jesus' hearers of this story would have been as conflicted about the setup as 
the first two characters that he introduces. Jesus has picked one of the 
debilitating edge cases in the Jewish customs surrounding the Law that would 
have caused great angst among his listeners. Part of me wonders if this was a 
common thought experiment in Jesus' day? "You're on the road and see a man who 
has been robbed and beaten nearly to death. WHAT DO YOU DO?" Or, maybe Jesus 
came up with the story all on his own. Either way, his hearers would have 
understood completely that this man needs help and surely God wants them to 
offer their help, yet God also told them to avoid contact with human blood.
The obvious, morally correct response is forbidden. What do they do?

At this point, Jesus could have simply stated that they priest or Levite should 
have behaved differently. With dramatic flare, he instead illustrates the 
correct response with the most dispicable character ever: a Samaritan. The 
popular, 20th-century interpretation of the word "Samaritan" is a do-gooder, but 
my breif bit of history should make clear that Jews had a very low opinion of
Samaritans. The Samaritan not only takes care of this man's immediate wounds but
even pays for the man's recovery expenses.
